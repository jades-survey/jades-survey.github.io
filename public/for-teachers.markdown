## JADES Educational Resources 
![For Teachers Splash](/assets/images/for_teachers.png)

The deep and varied JADES dataset is an ideal place for young scientists to learn about how 
galaxies form and grow. These observations span the entire history of the universe, and include 
deep images as well as spectra, where light is spread by its component wavelengths to help us 
understand the detailed properties of distant objects. On this page, we provide projects and 
activities developed JADES scientists that will introduce students to key topics in the science
of galaxies. 

The JADES science team has created outreach activities that cater a wide range of student
ages, and for each activity below, we provide a brief discription, and how it might fit into the 
curriculum for both US and UK-based students. 

If you use these and want to provide feedback, or contact the outreach and education wing of the
JADES collaboration, [please head here](link)! 

**This is a very busy time for the JADES scientists, and we're still putting together our 
outreach materials! Check back soon for an update with some great activities!**
