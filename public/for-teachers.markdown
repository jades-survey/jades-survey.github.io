## JADES Educational Resources 
![For Teachers Splash](/assets/images/for_teachers.png)

The deep and varied JADES dataset is an ideal place for young scientists to learn about how 
galaxies form and grow. These observations span the entire history of the universe, and include 
deep images as well as spectra, where light is spread by its component wavelengths to help us 
understand the detailed properties of distant objects. On this page, we provide projects and 
activities developed JADES scientists that will introduce students to key topics in the science
of galaxies. 

The JADES science team has created outreach activities that cater a wide range of student
ages, and for each activity below, we provide a brief description, and how it might fit into the 
curriculum for both US and UK-based students. 

If you use these and want to provide feedback, or contact the outreach and education wing of the
JADES collaboration, there are links included in each activity for you to send us your thoughts. 

### <font size="6">A Gazillion Galaxies</font>
----------

In this activity designed for younger students, participants will work in groups to look at 
real JADES galaxies and sort them by their properties, like color, size, and shape.

### <font size="6">Galactic Fingerprints</font>
----------

In this activity, designed for high-school age students, the participants will learn about
the spectra of distant galaxies, exploring what a spectrum is, and why galaxies have different
spectra.

In this activity, designed for older students, the participants will explore the concept of
redshift by looking at a very distant and unique source, GN-z11.
