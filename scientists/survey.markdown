The details of the JADES observing are described in 
Eisenstein et al. (2023, URL); this paper will be 
updated as the survey is completed.

JADES is about 770 mission hours and makes full use 
of coordinated parallels. About 620 hours are in GOODS-S, 
and 150 hours in GOODS-N. Although JADES is a Cycle 1 program, 
the size of the GOODS-S program proved too big to schedule in year 1. 
About 40% of this program was observed in Sept 2022 to Jan 2023; we 
plan that the rest will be observed in late 2023. The full GOODS-N program was observed in February to May 2023.

Here we show the footprint of the GOODS-N observing. 
The design features a mosaic of Medium-depth NIRCam imaging, on which we 
place a substantial amount of NIRSpec multi-shutter (MSA) spectroscopy. 
The NIRCam parallels from this spectroscopy then extends the imaging footprint.

The GOODS-S footprint is more complicated because in this field we also have 
our Deep imaging and spectroscopy. This figure shows this with different 
colors to distinguish Deep and Medium.

We stress that this GOODS-S footprint is not final, because the year 2 spectroscopy 
is still under planning. The position angles of the year 2 multi-shutter spectroscopy 
will depend on the assigned observing windows, and the exact locations will depend 
on the identification of high-priority targets. These decisions in turn determine where the NIRCam parallels fall.

[GOODS-S footprint picture(s). Would we like a version with the data  already taken?]

Most JADES NIRCam imaging uses 9 filters: F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F335M, F356W, 
F410M, and F444W. The NIRCam Medium parallels add F070W as a 10th filter. Some of the 
year 1 pointings omit F335M. All observations are done with
at least 6 dither locations, and often many more due to overlaps of the pointings.
Most JADES NIRSpec spectroscopy uses 5 dispersers: the R100 prism, the three

R=1000 gratings G140M, G235M, and G395M, and the higher resolution G395H grating. 
The shallowest data omits G395H. Unlike many programs, JADES allows most of the 
grating spectra to overlap, so as to increase the multiplex to match that 
of the prism mode. Our processing uses the prism spectra to identify which 
emission lines belong to which grating spectrum.

JADES is conducting very deep MIRI parallels in F770W as well as medium depth pa
rallels in F770W and F1280W. We were fortunate that the deep NIRCam parallel in
 year 1 fell on top of this deep MIRI data, making a particularly attractive sec
ondary deep field.

Like many year 1 programs, JADES has had to be adaptable to respond to operational hiccups with the telescope and instruments. These are described in Eisenstein et al. (2023), but contribute to some of the irregularities in the footprint pattern.
