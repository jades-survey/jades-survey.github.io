JADES is conducting an ambitious program of deep infrared imaging and multi-object spectroscopy,
using three JWST instruments, in the two most famous deep fields on the sky: the
Hubble Deep Field (GOODS-N) and Hubble Ultra Deep Field (GOODS-S).

Using over 1 month of mission time, JADES is the largest program in JWST Cycle 1. It
is a collaboration of the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Near-Infrared
Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument development team, using guaranteed time from
these teams as well as a smaller contribution from the MIRI-US team.

JADES is conducting NIRCam imaging in 8-10 bands, covering about 45 square
arcminutes to very deep limits (fainter than 30th magnitude) with an average of
about 130 hours of total exposure time, and then another 175 square arcminutes
to a typical exposure time of 20 hrs. Coordinated parallels with the MIRI
instrument extend this imaging further into the infrared in smaller regions.

JADES is then conducting extensive NIRSpec spectroscopy with over 5000 targets
on 31 separate pointings, including two of exceptional depth (55 hrs spread across
5 dispersers). These produce beautiful assessments of these faint galaxies.

JADES has already produced a series of important results, including the
highest redshift galaxy spectroscopically confirmed so far with JWST.
The first data release, comprising deep imaging and spectroscopy in and
around the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, is now available.
