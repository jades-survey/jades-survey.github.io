Data from JADES in and around the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
has provided the JWST spectroscopic confirmation of the earliest
galaxies confirmed thus far in the mission.  JADES used its 
very deep multi-color infrared images to identify high-redshift
galaxy candidates through their distinctive colors, as reported
in [Robertson et al. (2023)][Robertson].  We then used a very long
spectroscopic exposure, 28 hours!, to target four of these candidates,
confirming them to be at redshifts as high as 13.2.  The spectroscopic
discovery and analysis of the implications of the spectra are described
in [Curtis-Lake et al. (2023)][Curtis-Lake].

This work is described further in a [NASA blog post][Blog] and has since
been published in Nature Astronomy.
