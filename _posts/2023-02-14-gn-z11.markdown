In two papers, we present JADES data about the remarkable galaxy GN-z11.
This is the most luminous z>10 galaxy candidate in the GOODS-N field, discovered
originally with HST.  

JADES spectroscopy presented in [Bunker et al. (2023)][Bunker] shows
an amazing infrared NIRSpec spectrum for GN-z11, revealing at least
a dozen emission lines and giving a secure redshift of z=10.60.
Remarkably, we detect Lyman-alpha in emission, despite the expectation
that the IGM should be highly neutral.  We also find unusual line
ratios seemingly indicative of enhanced nitrogen abundance.

JADES imaging presented in [Tacchella et al. (2023)][Tacchella] detects GN-z11
at high signal-to-noise ratio in seven filters, showing a classic dropout 
spectral energy distribution.  The galaxy is quite compact, with half the
light interior to 100 pc, yet it is not point-like.  In addition to the 
mildly resolved core, there is a haze about 0.4" away that may or may not 
be associated.  We also find that GN-z11 may sit in an overdensity with 
nine other galaxies out to about 5 comoving Mpc away with photometric 
redshifts consistent with z=10.6.
